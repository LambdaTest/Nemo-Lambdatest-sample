* [Running The Parallel Tests With NemoJS](#running-the-parallel-tests-with-nemojs)

## Pre-requisites

Before starting running your Selenium tests with NemoJS, ensure you have the following things configured.

1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed. You can install it from the official [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/#home-downloadhead). You can also install NodeJS by running the following command in the terminal.

``` js
$ brew install node
```

2. Clone the repo.

``` js
$ git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/Nemo-Lambdatest-sample.git
  cd Nemo-Lambdatest-sample
```

3. Install the dependencies by executing the following command.

``` js
  npm install
```

4. To run your Selenium tests with NemoJS, you would need to set your LambdaTest username and access key in the environment variables. To get it, visit [Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=Nemo-Lambdatest-sample) and click on the Key button from the top-right.

**For Windows:**

``` js
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**For Mac/Linux:**

``` js
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

6. Set the environment variables in `nemo.config.js` file with your LambdaTest Username and Access Key.

## Running The Single Test Case With NemoJS

**Test Scenario:** To run your single test case with NemoJS on LambdaTest, let‚Äôs understand our test case scenario, the below Nemo.js automation script will test a sample to-do list app. The code marks two list items as done, adds a list item, and then outputs the total number of pending items. Check out the [nemo.test.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Nemo-Lambdatest-sample/blob/master/test/functional/nemo.test.js) file to run your first sample test. 

To run the single test, execute the below command in the terminal.

``` js
npx nemo -P chrome
```

## Running The Parallel Tests With NemoJS

**Test Scenario:** In this code, we will test our Sample to-do app in three browser versions and operating systems. Check out the [nemo.config.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Nemo-Lambdatest-sample/blob/master/nemo.config.js) file to run your first sample test. 

Now run the below command to run the parallel tests.

``` js
npx nemo -P chrome,chrome_2,firefox
```
